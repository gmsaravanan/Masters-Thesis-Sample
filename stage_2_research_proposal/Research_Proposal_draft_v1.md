## Background 


## Related Work
Controllable story generation has been studied from different angles. Earlier works have focused on controlling story generation using broad thematic elements such as sentiment, genre, style, topic, etc. (STORY_FROM_THEME). Some works have tried more fine-grained control using plot, story-plans and story-lines (STORY_FROM_PLOT). These works were benchmarked using relatively short-text datasets such as the 5-lines story dataset, ROCStories (Mostafazadeh, et al., 2016). Later on, some works have tried to controllable story generation with long-form text (LONG_STORY_GENERATION).
