## Background 


## Related Work
Controllable story generation has been studied from different angles. Earlier works have focused on controlling story generation using broad thematic elements such as sentiment, genre, style, topic, etc. (STORY_FROM_THEME). Some works have tried more fine-grained control using plot, story-plans and story-lines (STORY_FROM_PLOT). These works were benchmarked using relatively short-text datasets such as the 5-lines story dataset, ROCStories (Mostafazadeh, et al., 2016). Later on, some works have tried conditional and controllable story generation with long-form text (LONG_STORY_GENERATION). Similar to short story generation, researchers have tried using fine-grained control to drive story generation. (Fang, et al., 2021) proposed genneration of story given an outline of story events/phrases. (Rashkin et al., 2020) proposed a similar method using a dedicated architecture and memory mechanism.

Most of the research in the field is based on fine-tuning the Pre-trained Language Models (PLM) with curated or generated datasets. Recent works have proposed Plug-and-Play methods that control story generation without fine-tuning. (Jin, et al., 2022) proposed first generating a content plan fromt the PLM and then using the content plan to generate story body and ending.
